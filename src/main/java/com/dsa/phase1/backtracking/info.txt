Backtracking = recursion + control + pass by reference

*** Array and String are very important and should be practiced accordingly. :)


Problems - permutations of string

1. What is backtracking?
2. D/f between BT, DP and recursion?
3. pass by value vs pass by reference?
4. BT = Controlled recursion + pass by reference.


Backtracking -

In recursion there is always a 'recursion call stack' is created which saves the local variable and state of that function call.
This call stack handles the revert operation happens during backtracking.


Recursion = choices + decisions = we get solution in leaf node.

In generic cases below are its subtypes:
|- Dynamic Programming -> choices + decisions + (optimal) -> create sub problem and collectively solving them gives the answer. ->
   Get the answer in Root node.
|- Backtracking -> choices + decisions + pass by value + combinations -> asking about all combination. ->
   Get the answer as path from root to leaf node.
|- Divide and conquer - LATER
